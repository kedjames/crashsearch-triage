# CrashSearch
We designed CrashSearch for the specific purpose of efficiently mapping a reported bug to related known bugs within a bug datastore, including both exact and inexact duplicates. CrashSearch uses the symptoms of a crash to create a fingerprint that it uses to search for bugs with similar behaviors, and leverages sequential pattern mining to effectively showcase relationships among duplicate bugs.
